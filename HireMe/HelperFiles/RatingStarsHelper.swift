     The assumption is that the image views are all very close to each other sequentially, either horiztonally or vertically, like in a stack view.

     - Parameter stars: The image views that will be showing either a filled-in star or a blank star
     
     - Attention: The order of the image views for `stars` matters. Make sure to pass in the image views in the order you want the stars to display in.
